## Notes

Clicker Game Idea

The game is about trading in space

Basically you’re a space captain/pirate and you need to either visit planets or space ports and buy/sell goods

or you can attack other ships and plunder their goods arrr
and then sell them
the clicking part comes into play for the actual travel
so to get from one place to another, you select your destination on the map and that will dictate how much you have to click/tap

and you can also go mine stuff

 and that would require you tapping away as well
 cos mining is how you would build up enough money to buy your first ship

and you tap away to dig out of the jail? :D
 HAHAHAHAHA
 YES! Thats awesome!
 for long trips… you can either tap
 or watch an ad
 watching an ad will half the time you need to travel

 and you can watch up to X ads per trip or per day or whatever
 Same for the jail thing

 Do you think the whole game should just be limited to pirates?
 Probably simpler
 and more fun
yes
